<h2>Summary</h2>
  <p> In this product management analysis, we examined ZEE-5's current business model and provided valuable suggestions to solve their problems. Our primary focus was on optimizing their organizational structure, pricing strategy, and enhancing the user experience. To achieve this, we used frameworks such as Value Canvas, Petal Competitive Analysis, and Porter Five Forces.</p>

<h2> Objective</h2>
<ul>
<li>  Consolidate migration data into a standard data pattern</li>
<li>  Provide some reasoning behind these patterns to the Data Owner PHIA foundation for improved efforts by GOI</li>
</ul>


<h2> Problem</h2>

<p>The raw migration data was made available from PHIA foundation (implementation partner of GoJ 
and IIIT-B) with the help of Mr. Divya Raj, Principal Technical Strategist in the E-Health Research Centre 
(EHRC), IIIT-B who was directly involved in application development (i.e. Jharkhand Pravasi) for 
Jharkhand government.</p>

<h2>Regulations</h2> 
<ul>
<li>The data points have been encripyted as per the request of the supervisor and regulating authority </li>


<h2>Key challenges in migration data </h2>
<ul>
<li> Proportions of women migrated urban is 55%</li>
<li> Proportions of men migrated urban is 35% </li>
<li> Percentage of male that were found dependent is 42%</li>
<li> Percentage of female that were found dependent is 76%</li>
</ul>

<h2>Findings</h2>


<h2> Recommendations </h2>
<li> The study highlights the challenges faced by migrant workers in accessing healthcare in Bangalore, such as low awareness, financial constraints, and denial of social security schemes.</li>
<li> The study suggests using technological solutions like E sanjeevani and improving the visibility of primary healthcare centers (PHCs) through offline campaigns and social media. It also recommends using intermediaries like community nurses and factory health staff to engage with medical specialists and assist with tasks like booking appointments and prescribing medicines.</li>
<li> The study proposes that states can help by connecting migrants to nearby Asha workers and assisting with enrollment in social security schemes. Overall, the study highlights the need for better healthcare access for migrant workers and provides recommendations for addressing the challenges they face.</li>
